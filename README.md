This repository contains  my assessemnt from the module.

I study at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie).

### Introduction üëã

During the Programming For Data Analytics course, we worked on tasks assigned by the teacher. Over the weeks, we learned how to improve our programming skills, we also focused on creating better plots and visualizations. We learned how to use various libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, to generate more informative and visually appealing plots. This project showcases all the proposed tasks and reflects the progression of my learning throughout the course, particularly in visualizing data more effectively, we attended lessons and completed tasks that reinforced our learning.

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To run the code and follow along, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. One recommended option is to install Anaconda, which offers a free distribution and management environment. It comes pre-installed with all the essential packages and libraries required for Python programming.
